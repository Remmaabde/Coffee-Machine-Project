# Coffee Machine Project

Welcome to the Simple Coffee Machine Project implemented in Python. This project provides a user-friendly interface for ordering drinks, calculating prices, handling payments, and providing change.

## Features

- **User Interaction:** The program offers a simple and intuitive interface for users to select their preferred drinks.
  
- **Price Calculation:** The system calculates the total price based on the user's drink selection.

- **Payment Handling:** Users can enter their payment, and the program verifies if it meets or exceeds the total cost.

- **Change Calculation:** If the entered payment exceeds the total cost, the program calculates the change, converting any cents into dollars for user convenience.

## How to Use

1. Run the `coffee_machine.py` script using a Python interpreter.
    On bash
   python coffee_machine.py
   

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to select your desired drink and provide the necessary payment.

3. The program will display the total cost and, if applicable, the change.

4. Enjoy your coffee!
